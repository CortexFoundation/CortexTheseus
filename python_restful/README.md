# Cortex_Silencer
This is a demonstration to show Cortex project structure. It is a small but working prototype to show:

How to generate blocks;

How to call AI computational heavy functions  within smart contracts;

How the CVM was abstracted placed in the framework;

How the DAIApps would be developed.

The repository will be continuously updated along with the formal version of the development.
