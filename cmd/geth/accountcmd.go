		Description: `

    get wallet import /path/to/my/presale.wallet

will prompt for your password and imports your ether presale account.
It can be used non-interactively with the --password option taking a
passwordfile as argument containing the wallet password in plaintext.

`}
	accountCommand = cli.Command{
		Action: accountList,
		Name:   "account",
		Usage:  "manage accounts",
		Description: `

Manage accounts lets you create new accounts, list all existing accounts,
import a private key into a new account.

'            help' shows a list of subcommands or help for one subcommand.

It supports interactive mode, when you are prompted for password as well as
non-interactive mode where passwords are supplied via a given password file.
Non-interactive mode is only meant for scripted use on test networks or known
safe environments.

Make sure you remember the password you gave when creating a new account (with
either new or import). Without it you are not able to unlock your account.

Note that exporting your key in unencrypted format is NOT supported.

Keys are stored under <DATADIR>/keys.
It is safe to transfer the entire directory or the individual keys therein
between ethereum nodes by simply copying.
Make sure you backup your keys regularly.

In order to use your account to send transactions, you need to unlock them using
the '--unlock' option. The argument is a space separated list of addresses or
indexes. If used non-interactively with a passwordfile, the file should contain
the respective passwords one per line. If you unlock n accounts and the password
file contains less than n entries, then the last password is meant to apply to
all remaining accounts.

And finally. DO NOT FORGET YOUR PASSWORD.

				Usage:  "create a new account",
				Description: `

    ethereum account new

Creates a new account. Prints the address.

The account is saved in encrypted format, you are prompted for a passphrase.

You must remember this passphrase to unlock your account in the future.

For non-interactive use the passphrase can be specified with the --password flag:

    ethereum --password <passwordfile> account new

Note, this is meant to be used for testing only, it is a bad idea to save your
password to file or expose in any other way.
					`,
			},
			{
				Action: accountUpdate,
				Name:   "update",
				Usage:  "update an existing account",
				Description: `

    ethereum account update <address>

Update an existing account.

The account is saved in the newest version in encrypted format, you are prompted
for a passphrase to unlock the account and another to save the updated file.

This same command can therefore be used to migrate an account of a deprecated
format to the newest format or change the password for an account.

For non-interactive use the passphrase can be specified with the --password flag:

    ethereum --password <passwordfile> account update <address>

Since only one password can be given, only format update can be performed,
changing your password is only possible interactively.
					`,
			},
			{
				Action: accountImport,
				Name:   "import",
				Usage:  "import a private key into a new account",
				Description: `

    ethereum account import <keyfile>

Imports an unencrypted private key from <keyfile> and creates a new account.
Prints the address.

The keyfile is assumed to contain an unencrypted private key in hexadecimal format.

The account is saved in encrypted format, you are prompted for a passphrase.

You must remember this passphrase to unlock your account in the future.

For non-interactive use the passphrase can be specified with the -password flag:

    ethereum --password <passwordfile> account import <keyfile>

Note:
As you can directly copy your encrypted accounts to another ethereum instance,
this import mechanism is not needed when you transfer an account between
nodes.
