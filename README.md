Ethereum Go Client Â© 2014 Jeffrey Wilcke.

Current state: Proof of Concept 0.8

Ethereum is currently in its testing phase. 

Build
=====

To build Mist (GUI):

`go get github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/mist`

To build the node (CLI):

`go get github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/ethereum`

For further, detailed, build instruction please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Building-Ethereum(Go))

Automated (dev) builds
======================

* [[OS X](http://build.ethdev.com/builds/OSX%20Go%20develop%20branch/latest/app/)]
* [Windows] Coming soon&trade;
* [Linux] Coming soon&trade;

Binaries
========

Go Ethereum comes with several binaries found in
[cmd](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd):

* `mist` Official Ethereum Browser
* `ethereum` Ethereum CLI
* `ethtest` test tool which runs with the [tests](https://github.com/ethereum/testes) suit: 
  `cat file | ethtest`.
* `evm` is a generic Ethereum Virtual Machine: `evm -code 60ff60ff -gas
  10000 -price 0 -dump`. See `-h` for a detailed description.

Contribution
============

If you'd like to contribute to Ethereum please fork, fix, commit and
send a pull request. Commits who do not comply with the coding standards
are ignored (use gofmt!). If you send pull requests make absolute sure that you
commit on the `develop` branch and that you do not merge to master.
Commits that are directly based on master are simply ignored.

To make life easier try [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) it sets
this all up and streamlines your work flow.

Coding standards
================

Sources should be formatted according to the [Go Formatting
Style](http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#formatting).

Unless structs fields are supposed to be directly accesible, provide
Getters and hide the fields through Go's exporting facility.

When you comment put meaningfull comments. Describe in detail what you
want to achieve.

*wrong*

```go
// Check if the value at x is greater than y
if x > y {
    // It's greater!
}
```

Everyone reading the source probably know what you wanted to achieve
with above code. Those are **not** meaningful comments.

While the project isn't 100% tested I want you to write tests non the
less. I haven't got time to evaluate everyone's code in detail so I
expect you to write tests for me so I don't have to test your code
manually. (If you want to contribute by just writing tests that's fine
too!)
